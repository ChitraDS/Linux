**Shell** commands involving variable assignments and command substitution in Bash (or other POSIX-compliant shells), specifically in the form of `$(...)` and backticks `` `...` ``. Let's break down the examples you've provided and clarify the differences between them.

### Example 1: `echo $(var1=10; echo $var1)`

```bash
echo $(var1=10; echo $var1)
```

- **What this does**:
  - The `$(...)` syntax is used for **command substitution**. It runs the command inside the parentheses and replaces it with the output of that command.
  - In this case, the command inside the `$(...)` is `var1=10; echo $var1`.
    - `var1=10` sets the variable `var1` to `10`.
    - `echo $var1` outputs the value of `var1`, which is `10`.
  - So, the `$(...)` part returns the output of `echo $var1`, which is `10`.
  - The `echo` command outside the `$(...)` then prints this value, resulting in:

  ```bash
  10
  ```

- **Why it works**:
  - The assignment `var1=10` works because it is in a **subshell**. The variable `var1` exists only within the subshell scope created by the command substitution. After the command substitution finishes, the variable `var1` is no longer accessible in the parent shell.
  - So, the value `10` is captured and echoed back by `echo`.

### Example 2: `echo \`var1=10; echo $var1\``

```bash
echo `var1=10; echo $var1`
```

- **What this does**:
  - The **backticks** `` `...` `` are an older syntax for command substitution (replaced by `$(...)` for better readability).
  - Similar to the first example, `var1=10; echo $var1` is executed within the backticks.
    - The command `var1=10` sets `var1` to `10`.
    - The `echo $var1` will print the value of `var1`, which is `10`.
  - However, the output of the command inside the backticks is captured and printed by the outer `echo`.
  - So, this will also result in:

  ```bash
  10
  ```

- **Why it works**:
  - Just like with the `$()` form of substitution, backticks execute the command inside and return the result to the `echo` command outside, which prints `10`.

### Key Differences Between the Two:
1. **Command Substitution Syntax**:
   - `$(...)` is modern and preferred for readability and nesting commands. It’s easier to understand, especially when you need to nest substitutions.
   - Backticks (`` `...` ``) are older and less readable, especially when nested.

2. **Scope of Variable**:
   - In both cases, the variable `var1` is set within the scope of the command substitution (a subshell), so its value (`10`) is visible only within the scope of the `$(...)` or `` `...` ``.
   - The parent shell doesn’t have access to `var1` once the command substitution is completed.

### Nested Command Substitution Example

If you were to nest command substitutions, the difference between `$()` and backticks becomes more apparent.

- **Using `$(...)`** (easy to read and nest):

  ```bash
  echo $(echo $(echo hello))
  ```

  This works smoothly, with no issues with readability or nesting.

- **Using backticks** (harder to read):

  ```bash
  echo `echo \`echo hello\``
  ```

  Here, you must escape inner backticks with a backslash, which can be confusing and error-prone.

### Conclusion:

- Both the `$(...)` and backticks `` `...` `` work similarly when performing command substitution in shells, and both can capture the output of commands, including variable assignments.
- It's recommended to use `$(...)` for better readability, especially in complex or nested substitutions.
