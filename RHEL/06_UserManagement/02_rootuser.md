In Linux, environment variables play a crucial role in configuring user-specific settings and system-wide behavior. The commands you've mentioned (`su root`, `su -`, `sudo su`) all impact the shell environment differently, especially in terms of environment variables. Here's a detailed breakdown of how they behave with respect to environment variables, particularly in relation to the `~/.bash_profile` file:

### 1. **`su root`**:
   - **Description**: This command switches the user to the root user, but it does **not load** the root user's environment completely.
   - **Effect on Environment Variables**: 
     - When you run `su root`, the shell **inherits the environment** of the user who ran the command (i.e., the current user). It doesn't load the root user's environment settings from `/root/.bash_profile` or other initialization files.
     - The `$PATH` and other environment variables will be the same as the current user’s, with the user context temporarily switched to root.
   - **Environment Variables**:
     - `$HOME` will still point to the current user's home directory.
     - `$USER` will remain as the current user, not root.
     - **No login environment**: It does not source `~/.bash_profile`, so custom configurations in `~/.bash_profile` (like setting environment variables) won't be applied.
   
   **Example**:
   ```bash
   su root
   echo $HOME      # Shows current user's home directory, not /root
   echo $USER      # Shows the current user's username, not "root"
   ```

### 2. **`su -`** (or `su - root`):
   - **Description**: This command **simulates a full login** as the root user by loading all of the root user's environment, including `/root/.bash_profile`.
   - **Effect on Environment Variables**:
     - When using `su -` (or `su - root`), the shell **completely switches to root's environment**.
     - Environment variables such as `$HOME`, `$USER`, and `$PATH` are set according to the root user’s environment.
     - **Login Shell**: The `-` indicates a login shell, meaning it will **source the root user's login files**, including `/root/.bash_profile`.
   - **Environment Variables**:
     - `$HOME` will point to `/root`.
     - `$USER` will be set to `root`.
     - The `$PATH` will reflect root's path configuration, which may differ from the regular user's `$PATH`.
     - Any environment variables set in `/root/.bash_profile` will be loaded and available.
   
   **Example**:
   ```bash
   su -
   echo $HOME      # Shows /root
   echo $USER      # Shows root
   echo $PATH      # Shows root's PATH, which may include more system-level directories
   ```

### 3. **`sudo su`**:
   - **Description**: This command runs the `su` command (which switches to root) with `sudo` privileges.
   - **Effect on Environment Variables**:
     - Unlike `su root`, `sudo su` **preserves** most of the environment variables from the calling user, as `sudo` tries to maintain the environment when it switches to the root user (unless overridden in `/etc/sudoers`).
     - The root user's environment is not fully loaded, meaning `/root/.bash_profile` is **not** sourced by default.
   - **Environment Variables**:
     - The `$HOME` will point to the original user's home directory, not `/root`.
     - `$USER` will stay as the original user, not root.
     - `$PATH` will remain the same as the calling user's path.
   
   **Example**:
   ```bash
   sudo su
   echo $HOME      # Shows current user's home directory
   echo $USER      # Shows the current user's username
   ```

### Key Differences:

| Command         | Behavior on Environment Variables                     | Effect on `.bash_profile`       | `$USER`, `$HOME`, and `$PATH` |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `su root`       | Does not load root's environment, inherits caller's env. | **Does not source** `/root/.bash_profile` | `$HOME` stays as the caller's home directory. `$USER` stays as the caller's username. |
| `su -` (or `su - root`) | Loads root's environment fully.                    | **Sources** `/root/.bash_profile` | `$HOME` points to `/root`, `$USER` becomes `root`, `$PATH` becomes root's. |
| `sudo su`       | Preserves the calling user's environment.              | **Does not source** `/root/.bash_profile` | `$HOME` and `$USER` remain as the calling user's values. |

### Summary:
- **`su root`**: Switches to root but keeps the current user's environment.
- **`su -`**: Switches to root and loads root's full environment, including `.bash_profile`.
- **`sudo su`**: Uses `sudo` to switch to root but does not fully load root's environment or source `.bash_profile`.

The primary difference lies in how the environment is inherited or reset, and whether the `.bash_profile` (or equivalent) is sourced for a complete login shell experience.
