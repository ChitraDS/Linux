The `nano` editor is a simple, easy-to-use text editor for Unix-like systems, including Linux distributions like Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Unlike `vi`, which has multiple modes (Normal, Insert, Command), `nano` is more straightforward with a more user-friendly interface, making it ideal for beginners.

Here’s a detailed guide to using the `nano` editor.
