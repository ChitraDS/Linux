The `vi` editor is one of the most powerful and widely used text editors in Linux, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). It's available in most Unix-like systems and can be used for editing configuration files, scripts, and other plain text files. Here's a guide to the basic and advanced commands for using `vi`.

### **Opening and Closing Files**

- **Open a file in `vi`:**
  ```bash
  vi filename
  ```

- **Open a file in read-only mode:**
  ```bash
  vi -R filename
  ```

- **Exit `vi` editor:**
  - **Without saving changes:**  
    Press `Esc` and type:
    ```bash
    :q!
    ```

  - **Saving and exiting:**  
    Press `Esc` and type:
    ```bash
    :wq
    ```

  - **Saving (without quitting):**  
    Press `Esc` and type:
    ```bash
    :w
    ```

  - **Quit `vi` (if no changes were made):**  
    Press `Esc` and type:
    ```bash
    :q
    ```

### **Modes in `vi`**

`vi` has three primary modes:

1. **Normal mode (Command mode)**:

   You can edit text in this mode. Press `i` to enter insert mode. Press `Esc` to return to normal mode.

3. **Command mode (Colon mode)**:  
   In this mode, you can issue commands to `vi`, such as save, quit, search, etc. You enter this mode by pressing `:` from normal mode.
