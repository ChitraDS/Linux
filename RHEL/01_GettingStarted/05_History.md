The **`history`** command in Linux (including Red Hat, CentOS, and other Unix-like systems) is used to display a list of previously executed commands. This feature is useful for recalling commands you've run in the past and rerunning them without having to retype them completely.

### **Using the `history` Command**

1. **Display the Command History:**
   - When you type `history` at the command prompt, it will display a list of commands that were previously entered, along with their line numbers. The default number of commands displayed is typically 1000, but this can be adjusted.
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     history
     ```
     Output:
     ```
     1  ls -l
     2  cd /home/user
     3  mkdir new_directory
     4  echo "Hello, World!"
     ```

2. **Display a Specific Number of Previous Commands:**
   - You can specify a number to display the last **n** commands from your history. For example, to display the last 10 commands:
   - **Example:**
     ```bash
     history 10
     ```
   - This will show the last 10 commands you executed.

### **Running a Specific Command Using `!` (Event Designators)**

The `!` character is used to reference and execute commands from your history based on their event number (the number displayed next to each command in the `history` output).

#### **Examples of Using `!` for Running Specific Commands:**

1. **Run a Command by its Event Number:**
   - If you want to run the 3rd command from your history:
     ```bash
     !3
     ```
   - This will execute the command with event number 3 (e.g., `mkdir new_directory` in the previous example).

2. **Run the Last Command:**
   - To rerun the last command executed (similar to pressing the up arrow):
     ```bash
     !!
     ```
   - This executes the last command from the history. For example, if your last command was `echo "Hello, World!"`, it will execute `echo "Hello, World!"` again.

3. **Run a Command Starting with a Specific String:**
   - You can also run the last command that started with a specific string:
     ```bash
     !echo
     ```
   - This will run the most recent command starting with `echo`. In the previous example, it would rerun `echo "Hello, World!"`.

4. **Run a Command by Searching with `!<string>`:**
   - For example, if you previously ran a command like `ls -l` and want to run it again, you can use:
     ```bash
     !ls
     ```
   - This will execute the most recent `ls` command from your history.

5. **Run the Command Before a Specific Event Number:**
   - You can also use `!` to run the command before a certain event number.
     ```bash
     !-2
     ```
   - This will run the second-to-last command in your history (e.g., `cd /home/user` if it was the second-to-last command).

### **Modifying the History Size with `$HISTSIZE`**

The **`$HISTSIZE`** environment variable defines the number of commands that the shell keeps in the history list. By default, this value is typically set to 1000, but you can change it to retain more or fewer commands.

#### **Examples of Using `$HISTSIZE`:**

1. **Check the Current Value of `$HISTSIZE`:**
   - To view the current history size limit, you can check the value of the `$HISTSIZE` variable:
     ```bash
     echo $HISTSIZE
     ```
   - This will display the current limit, e.g., `1000`.

2. **Change the History Size Temporarily (for the Current Session):**
   - To increase or decrease the number of commands saved in your history for the current session, use:
     ```bash
     export HISTSIZE=5000
     ```
   - This changes the history size to 5000 commands for the current session only.

3. **Change the History Size Permanently:**
   - To permanently change the history size, add the `export HISTSIZE` line to your shell configuration file (e.g., `~/.bashrc` for the Bash shell):
     ```bash
     echo "export HISTSIZE=5000" >> ~/.bashrc
     ```
   - After modifying the `.bashrc` file, apply the changes by running:
     ```bash
     source ~/.bashrc
     ```

4. **Clear History (Optional):**
   - If you wish to clear the history list completely:
     ```bash
     history -c
     ```
   - This command will clear the history list for the current session, but it won't affect the history file unless you manually delete it (e.g., `~/.bash_history`).

The variables **`HISTFILE`** and **`HISTFILESIZE`** are used in Bash to control the behavior of the shell's history feature. These settings allow you to define the file where the command history is stored and limit the size of the history file. Here's an explanation of both:

### 1. **`HISTFILE`**
   - **Definition**: The `HISTFILE` variable defines the file where the shell's command history is saved.
   - By default, this is typically set to `~/.bash_history` (i.e., the `.bash_history` file in your home directory).
   - This file contains the list of commands youâ€™ve previously run in the shell, and this history can be used for things like command recall and autocompletion.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   echo $HISTFILE
   # Outputs: /home/user/.bash_history (or similar, depending on your system configuration)
   ```

   - You can change the location of the history file by modifying the value of `HISTFILE`. For example:
   
     ```bash
     export HISTFILE="/path/to/your/history/file"
     ```

### 2. **`HISTFILESIZE`**
   - **Definition**: The `HISTFILESIZE` variable defines the maximum number of lines (commands) the history file can store. Once the limit is reached, older commands will be deleted from the file as new commands are added.
   - The default size for `HISTFILESIZE` is typically set to `500` or `1000` lines, depending on the system configuration.

   **Example**:
   ```bash
   echo $HISTFILESIZE
   # Outputs: 1000 (this means the history file can hold up to 1000 commands)
   ```

   - You can adjust this value by setting a new value for `HISTFILESIZE`:

     ```bash
     export HISTFILESIZE=2000  # Increase history file size to 2000 commands
     ```

### Example: Configuring Both `HISTFILE` and `HISTFILESIZE`

You can configure both variables to customize the history behavior. For instance:

```bash
export HISTFILE="$HOME/.my_custom_history"
export HISTFILESIZE=5000
```

This configuration would:
- Store your history in `~/.my_custom_history`.
- Allow the file to store up to 5000 commands.

### Other Related History Variables

There are other related environment variables that help manage Bash history:

- **`HISTSIZE`**: Specifies the number of commands to remember in the current session (not to be confused with `HISTFILESIZE`, which controls the number of commands stored in the history file).
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  export HISTSIZE=2000  # Keep 2000 commands in the current session's history
  ```

- **`HISTCONTROL`**: Determines how history entries are stored, e.g., ignore duplicates, ignore commands starting with a space, etc.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  export HISTCONTROL=ignoredups  # Do not save duplicate commands
  ```



- **`HISTFILE`** specifies the file where your command history is stored.
- **`HISTFILESIZE`** limits the size of the history file by defining the maximum number of commands it can hold.


### **Summary of Key Points:**

- **`history`** shows the list of previous commands.
- **`!<event_number>`** runs a specific command from history based on its event number (e.g., `!3` runs the command at event number 3).
- **`!!`** reruns the last command.
- **`!<string>`** reruns the most recent command starting with a specific string (e.g., `!echo`).
- **`$HISTSIZE`** sets the number of commands to be saved in the history list.
- Use **`history -c`** to clear the history for the current session.

By using the `history` command effectively, you can quickly repeat past commands and streamline your workflow in the Linux shell.
