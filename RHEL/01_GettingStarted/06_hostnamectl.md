In Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and other systemd-based Linux distributions, the `hostnamectl` command is used to manage the system's hostname and related settings. Below are some common `hostnamectl` commands for managing and viewing hostnames:

### 1. **View current hostname**
   To display the current hostname, use:
   ```bash
   hostnamectl
   ```

### 2. **Set static hostname**
   To set the system's hostname (e.g., `myserver`), use:
   ```bash
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname myserver
   ```

   This sets the static hostname and will apply immediately.

### 3. **Set pretty hostname**
     A "pretty" hostname is a human-readable name for your system. This is optional and can contain spaces and other characters. For example:
   ```bash
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname "My Server" --pretty
   ```

### 4. **Set transient hostname**
   The transient hostname is temporary and typically assigned by a DHCP server. It’s reset on reboot. To set it:
   ```bash
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname temp-hostname --transient
   ```

### 5. **Set a machine ID**
   The machine ID is a unique identifier for your machine, which can be modified if needed. To set a machine ID:
   ```bash
   sudo hostnamectl set-machine-id <new-machine-id>
   ```

### 6. **Check hostname status**
   To get detailed information about the system’s hostname configuration, run:
   ```bash
   hostnamectl status
   ```
   This will show information about the static, transient, and pretty hostnames, along with other system details like the operating system and kernel version.

### 7. **Set the chassis type**
   The chassis type describes the physical form factor of the system (e.g., "desktop," "laptop," "server"). To set it:
   ```bash
   sudo hostnamectl set-chassis laptop
   ```

### 8. **Reset the hostname**
   If you want to reset the hostname to the default (which might be the machine's name or something generated by the system), use:
   ```bash
   sudo hostnamectl set-hostname --static ""
   ```

### Example of changing the hostname:
To change the static hostname to `newhost`:
```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname newhost
```
This command modifies the static hostname. After this, you may need to edit `/etc/hosts` to reflect the new hostname if needed for resolving local names.
