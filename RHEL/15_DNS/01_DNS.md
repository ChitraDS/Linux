A **DNS (Domain Name System) server** is a specialized server that helps translate domain names (like `www.example.com`) into IP addresses (like `192.0.2.1`). The DNS system works similarly to a phone book for the internet, allowing users to access websites using human-readable domain names instead of needing to memorize numerical IP addresses.

Here's a more detailed breakdown of how DNS works:

1. **Domain Name Lookup**: When you type a URL (like `www.google.com`) into your web browser, the browser needs to find the IP address associated with that domain name to connect to the correct web server.
  
2. **DNS Query**: The browser sends a query to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into its corresponding IP address.

3. **DNS Resolution**: The DNS server checks its database for the IP address. If the server doesn't have the answer, it will ask other DNS servers in a hierarchical manner until the correct IP address is found.

4. **Response**: Once the DNS server finds the correct IP address, it sends the information back to the browser, allowing it to connect to the website.

In simple terms, DNS servers act as the translators between easy-to-remember domain names and the technical numerical addresses that computers use to communicate with each other.
