The **`yum grouplist`** command is used to list package groups available in the repositories configured on your system. A **package group** is a collection of related packages that can be installed or removed together, making it easier to install sets of tools or software for specific use cases.

### **`yum grouplist` Command**

The `yum grouplist` command shows all available and installed package groups in the enabled repositories. These groups are categorized based on the use case, such as "Development Tools," "Web Server," "Server with GUI," etc.

### **Example 1: `yum grouplist`**

```bash
yum grouplist
```

**Explanation**:
- This command will show a list of all available package groups and a list of installed groups (if any).
- It displays groups such as "Development Tools," "Server with GUI," "Web Server," and others, along with their status (available or installed).
  
**Output example**:
```bash
Loaded plugins: fastestmirror, langpacks
Available Groups:
   Development Tools
   Server with GUI
   Web Server
   Virtualization Host
   ...
Installed Groups:
   Minimal Install
   Development Tools
```

### **Example 2: `yum grouplist hidden`**

To see hidden or less common groups, you can use the `hidden` option.

```bash

This will show groups that are not typically displayed by default.
